# Color Sorting Conveyor System
An automated DIY color sorting system for objects using Arduino. The system detects objects passing on a conveyor belt, stops them, and identifies each object's color.

## Project Description
This project simulates an industrial sorting conveyor belt that automatically detects and identifies object colors using custom color sensing technology.

## Components
- Arduino UNO - Main controller

- Relay - Motor control

- 5V DC Motor - Conveyor belt drive

- Custom Color Sensor:

  - Photoresistor (light intensity detection)

  - RGB LED module (color illumination)

- Color Indicator LEDs:

  - Red

  - Blue

  - Green

## Functionality
1.Industrial Simulation - Replicates industrial conveyor belt operations

2.Object Detection - HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor detects objects on the belt

3.Automated Control - Stops conveyor when object is detected

4.Color Detection Cycle:

  - RGB module illuminates each color sequentially

  - Photoresistor measures light intensity for each color

  - Microcontroller processes readings to determine object color

5.Output & Continuation - Displays detected color and resumes conveyor operation

## Technical Features
- Custom Color Sensing - Proprietary color detection using RGB sequencing

- Real-time Processing - Immediate object detection and color analysis

- Modular Design - Easy integration with additional subsystems

## Expansion Possibilities
- Extended Color Range - Capable of detecting up to 6 different colors

- System Integration - Designed for future subsystem integration

- Scalable Architecture - Adaptable for industrial applications

Project Structure
***This project uses joined files concept for program execution. Specifically designed for future subsystem integration and modular expansion.***
